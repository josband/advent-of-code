# ðŸ¦Œ Advent of Code ðŸŽ„

Welcome to my Advent of Code! I am completing this year's (and possibly future years) in Rust to practice the language and
write hopefully significantly cleaner code. I am hoping to complete every day on the day, but life happens, so I will do
my best. If I have free time, I will try to add some utilities to track performance or make adding additional days easier.
